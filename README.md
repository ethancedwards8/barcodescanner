This an application developed by Ethan Edwards and Cody Viars to ease their day to day processes.



# NOTES
We need to be able to authenticate with Google Sheets. It turns out, an API key is needed. However, a public API key is admissible.

We may be able to use the frontend OpenSheet (https://benborgers.com/posts/google-sheets-without-oauth and https://github.com/benborgers/opensheet) to interact with the Google Sheets API. It can perform GET's, but sadly not POST's or PUT's. Because of that limitation it may not be helpful.
